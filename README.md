## The Rick & Morty Show

The project displays a few characters of The Rick and Morty Show. Each character has its own card with some details. We can search a character by its name, can add filters to view a particular kind of detail or a set of them. Also, the functionality of sorting them by their ids both in ascending and descending order is present. This is a great exercise to learn React while implementing sort, filter and search.

Application consists of base components which are used in the "Character" container component. Pure CSS is used without any third party design library.

The application also looks great in responsive view ie across all devices.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
